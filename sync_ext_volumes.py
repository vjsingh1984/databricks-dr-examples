# sync_ext_volumes.py
#
# Baseline script to sync GRS-replicated volumes from a primary metastore to a secondary metastore
#
# NOTE: This script must be run in the PRIMARY workspace.
#
# This script will attempt to register all _external_ volumes in the primary metastore into the secondary metastore.
# This assumes that all storage locations are identical between the two regions, i.e., georeplicated storage has been
# used. Storage URLs are not updated; they are just directly brought over to the secondary metastore. Files within the
# volumes will not be replicated, since the underlying storage will be georeplicated.
#
# Params that must be specified below:
#   -target_host: the hostname of the secondary workspace.
#   -target_pat: an access token for the secondary workspace; must be an ADMIN user.
#   -catalogs_to_copy: a list of the catalogs to be replicated; only volumes within these catalogs will be replicated.
#   -num_exec: the number of threads to spawn in the ThreadPoolExecutor.
