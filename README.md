# Databricks Disaster Recovery (DR) Sync Tools

Collection of scripts for syncing Unity Catalog resources between Databricks workspaces for Disaster Recovery purposes.

## Overview

This repository provides production-ready scripts for replicating Unity Catalog resources between Databricks workspaces. It supports:

- **Data sync**: Tables, views, volumes, models, external locations, storage credentials
- **Metadata sync**: Permissions, schemas, catalogs, cluster policies, instance pools
- **Workspace sync**: Jobs, workflows, notebooks, secret scopes
- **AWS support**: IAM roles, S3 cross-region replication, instance profiles, Secrets Manager
- **Safety features**: Dry-run mode, checkpointing/resume, structured logging, CSV validation

## New Features

### Unified CLI

All sync scripts now support a unified CLI interface:

```bash
# Run all sync modules in dependency order
dr-sync run --all

# Run specific modules
dr-sync run catalogs tables views jobs

# Dry-run to preview changes
dr-sync run --all --dry-run

# Selective filtering
dr-sync run --all --include "prod.*.*" --exclude "*.staging.*"

# Resume from last checkpoint
dr-sync run --all --resume

# Checkpoint management
dr-sync checkpoint list
dr-sync checkpoint clear jobs

# List available sync modules
dr-sync list
```

### Checkpoint/Resume

Long-running sync operations can now be resumed after failures. Completed items are tracked in `.dr_sync_state/` and skipped on subsequent runs with `--resume`.

### Structured Logging

All scripts use Python logging with configurable levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`). Output includes timestamps and log levels for production monitoring.

### Environment Variable Configuration

Alternative to `common.py`, use environment variables with the `DR_SYNC_*` prefix:

```bash
export DR_SYNC_SOURCE_HOST=https://primary.cloud.databricks.com
export DR_SYNC_SOURCE_TOKEN=dapi...
export DR_SYNC_TARGET_HOST=https://secondary.cloud.databricks.com
export DR_SYNC_TARGET_TOKEN=dapi...
export DR_SYNC_CATALOGS_TO_COPY="prod_catalog,analytics_catalog"

python sync_tables.py --dry-run
```

### Test Suite

Install with development dependencies to run the test suite:

```bash
make install-dev
pytest
```

Currently 40 unit tests with 53% code coverage.
These scripts generally assume that they will be run on a notebook in the primary workspace, and that the workspace can directly access the secondary workspace via SDK; this may not always be true in your environment. You have two options if connectivity issues are preventing scripts from running:
- Alter the workspace networking to allow connectivity; this may involve adjusting firewalls, adding peering, etc.
- Run the scripts remotely using Databricks Connect

In the latter option, the following adjustments need to be made:
- Set up [Databricks Connect](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-connect/python/index.html) in your environment
- In all scripts, add an import statement for Databricks Connect, i.e., `from databricks.connect import DatabricksSession`
- In all scripts, instantiate a Spark Session, i.e., `spark = DatabricksSession.builder.profile("<profile-name>").getOrCreate()`

These changes will allow the code to run remotely on a local machine or cloud VM.

## Repo Contents
Snippets that demonstrate basic functionality (located in /examples/):
- clone_to_secondary.py: performs `DEEP CLONE` on a set of catalogs in the primary to a storage location in the secondary region.
- clone_to_secondary_par.py: parallelized version of clone_to_secondary.py.
- create_tables_simple.py: simple script that must be run *in the secondary region* to register managed/external tables based on the output of clone_to_secondary.py.
- sync_views.py: simple script to sync views; this will need to be updated per your environment.


Code samples that show more comprehensive end-to-end functionality:
- sync_creds_and_locs.py: script to sync storage credentials and external locations between primary and secondary metastores. Run locally or on either primary/secondary.
- sync_catalogs_and_schemas.py: script to sync all catalogs and schemas from a primary metastore to a secondary metastore. Run locally or on either primary/secondary.
- sync_tables.py: performs a deep clone of all managed external tables, and registers those tables in the secondary region.
- sync_grs_ext.py: sync _metadata only_ for external tables that have already been replicated via cloud provider georeplication. No data is copied, and storage URLs on both workspaces will be the same.
- sync_ext_volumes.py: sync _metadata only_ for external volumes that have already been replicated via cloud provider georeplication.
- sync_perms.py: sync all permissions related to UC tables, volumes, schemas and catalogs from primary to secondary metastore.
- sync_shared_tables.py: sync tables using Delta Sharing. All tables will be imported to the secondary region as managed tables.

### Syncing External Locations and Credentials

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Update the credential and external location mapping files:
   - <cloud>_cred_mapping.csv: 
     - `source_cred_name` should contain the storage credential name in the source metastore
     - for AWS, `target_iam_role` should contain the ARN for the iam role to be used in the target metastore
     - for Azure, only ONE of the following should be used:
       - `target_mgd_id_connector`: used for standard access connectors (i.e., azure managed identities)
       - `target_mgd_id_identity`: used for user-assigned managed identities
       - `target_sp_directory`, `target_sp_appid`, and `target_sp_secret`: if a service principal is used for access (uncommon)
   - ext_location_mapping.csv:
     - `source_loc_name` should contain the external location name in the source metastore
     - `target_url` should contain the storage URL to be used for the location in the secondary metastore
     - `target_access_pt` should contain the S3 access point to be used (optional, only for AWS)

3. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python sync_creds_and_locs.py
```

### Syncing Catalogs and Schemas

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Update the catalog and schema mapping CSVs:
   - catalog_mapping.csv: `source_catalog` should contain a list of the source catalog names to be migrated, and `target_storage_root` should contain the storage root location for each catalog in the target metastore
   - schema_mapping.csv: `source_catalog` and `source_schema` should contain the catalogs and schemas in the source metastore, and `target_storage_root` should contain the storage root location for each schema in the target metastore

3. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python sync_catalogs_and_schemas.py
```

### Syncing Tables

Below are two options for syncing tables. Option 1 leverages Delta sharing to clone the tables, whereas Option 2 requires you to delta deep clone the tables in the source/primary region to an intermediary cloud storage bucket before re-creating the tables as managed tables in the target/secondary metastore.

#### Option 1: Syncing Managed Tables via Delta Sharing

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python sync_shared_tables.py
```

#### Option 2: Syncing Managed Tables with an Intermediary Storage Account

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python sync_tables.py
```

#### Option 3: Syncing External Tables

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python sync_grs_ext.py
```

### Syncing External Volumes

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python sync_ext_volumes.py
```

### Syncing Views

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python sync_views.py
```

### Syncing Jobs and Workflows

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python sync_jobs.py
```

This syncs job definitions (tasks, clusters, schedules) from source to target workspace. Use `--dry-run` to preview.

### Syncing Cluster Policies

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python sync_cluster_policies.py
```

This syncs cluster policy definitions. Policies are created with identical JSON in the target.

### Syncing Instance Pools

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python sync_instance_pools.py
```

For AWS cross-region deployments, instance types can be automatically remapped between regions.

### Syncing Instance Profiles (AWS)

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python sync_instance_profiles.py
```

This registers AWS IAM instance profiles in the target workspace. The IAM roles must already exist in the target AWS account.

### Syncing Secret Scopes

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python sync_secret_scopes.py
```

This syncs secret scope metadata and ACLs. Note: Secret values are NOT synced. For Databricks-backed scopes, recreate secrets manually. For AWS Secrets Manager-backed scopes, ensure the AWS secret exists in the target account.

### Syncing Notebooks

1. Make sure `common.py` is updated with all relevant parameters

2. Once you have updated the configuration, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python sync_notebooks.py
```

This exports notebooks from the source workspace and imports them to the target workspace, preserving folder structure. Supports SOURCE, JUPYTER, and DBC formats.
